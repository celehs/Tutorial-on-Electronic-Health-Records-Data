    "text": "2 UMLS: Unified Medical Language System\nUMLS (Unified Medical Language System) [1] is a large language system that unifies medical concept coding, typing, relations between medical concepts, etc. It is not only a standard, but also a large database. In brief, the UMLS is a comprehensive dictionary containing considerable medical terms and relations between them.\nYou can download data and consult the documentation on the UMLS website 1 .\n\n2.0.1 Concepts as CUIs in UMLS\nIt is desirable to have a unique identifier for each concept. In the UMLS, the identifier is called CUI (Unique Concept Identifier). The CUI consists of a C followed by several digits such as C0021400 (Influenza).\nAs we mentioned in the last section, each concept usually has more than one name or aliases. In the UMLS, we refer to these names or aliases as String. Thus, we can say that each CUI usually has more than one string.\nAmong all strings under the same concept, there is always a preferred string which is seen as a preferred name of the concept. Researchers usually use preferred names to refer to Concepts because CUIs are difficult to recognize by humans.\nAll of the CUIs and strings are defined by table MRCONSO in the UMLS which contains 4,536,653 concepts with 16,543,671 strings in total. Table 2.1 is an example of a concept with its strings.\n\n\nTable 2.1: An example of CUIs and strings in UMLS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConcept (CUI)\nPreferred string of concept\nAll strings of concept\n\n\n\n\nC0004238\nAtrial Fibrillation\nAtrial Fibrillation\nAtrial Fibrillations\nAuricular Fibrillation\nAuricular Fibrillations\n\n\n\n\nIn addition to CUIs and strings, MRCONSO also provides other information about medical terms, such as language, source vocabularies, types, etc. The MRCONSO is a table of the UMLS, and here 2 is the description of all columns of the table. Here, we only introduce some of them\n\nCUI: Unique identifier for concept\nLAT: Language of the term\nSTR: String of the term\nSUPPRESS: Suppressible flag, indicating whether the entry is obsolete\n\nWith the entries in MRCONSO, we can extract all strings under the same CUI easily."
